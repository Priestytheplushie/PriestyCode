## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in PriestyCode, we ask that you report it to us privately as soon as possible. **Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue or discuss the vulnerability publicly until it has been resolved and disclosed.**

**1. How to Report:**

The most secure and preferred method for reporting vulnerabilities is via our dedicated security email address:

* **Email:** `priestyinc@gmail.com`

**2. Information to Include:**

To help us quickly understand, reproduce, and address the issue, please provide as much detail as possible in your report:

* **A clear and concise description** of the vulnerability.
* **Steps to reproduce:** Detailed, actionable instructions, including code snippets, configurations, or URLs where applicable.
* **Affected versions or components:** Specify which versions of PriestyCode are impacted.
* **Potential impact:** Describe what a successful exploit could achieve (e.g., data breach, denial of service, unauthorized access).
* **Your contact information:** Your email address and, optionally, your Twitter handle or other preferred method for us to follow up with you.
* (Optional) Any suggested fixes or workarounds you may have discovered.

## Our Commitment and What to Expect

Once you've reported a vulnerability, here's what you can expect from our team:

* **Initial Acknowledgement:** We aim to acknowledge receipt of your security report within **2 business days** (Monday - Friday, excluding holidays).
* **Investigation and Validation:** Our team will investigate the reported vulnerability to determine its validity and severity.
* **Communication:** We will keep you informed of our progress and any questions we may have during the investigation. We will provide an initial assessment and estimated timeline for a fix within **5 business days** for validated vulnerabilities.
* **Resolution:** We will work diligently to develop and test a fix.
* **Public Disclosure:** Once a fix is developed, tested, and released, we will coordinate with you on public disclosure. This typically involves publishing a security advisory (e.g., on GitHub Security Advisories or in release notes) and crediting your discovery, unless you prefer to remain anonymous. We follow a coordinated disclosure process to ensure our users have adequate time to update.

We operate under a **"no blame" policy** and will not pursue legal action against individuals who report vulnerabilities in good faith and adhere to responsible disclosure principles by keeping the vulnerability confidential until a fix is released.
