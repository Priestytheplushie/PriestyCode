            No worries, this is a normal part of collaborating. Here are a few ways we can get this sorted:
            1. **Use My Suggestions (Easiest):** For most conflicts, you can simply head to the **[Files changed tab]({pr.html_url}/files)** and click the **"Commit suggestion"** button on the comments I've left. This will automatically apply the suggested change to your branch and create a new commit.
            2. **Use the GitHub Web Editor:** If a conflict needs a custom fix, the **[Resolve conflicts button]({pr.html_url}/conflicts)** is your best friend.

            Merge conflicts happen when the same lines of code are changed in different ways on different branches. They're a normal part of collaborative development and nothing to worry about!
            
            **What causes merge conflicts?**
            - Two people edit the same line of code differently
            - One person edits a line while another person deletes it
            - Complex changes that Git can't automatically merge
            
            **How to resolve them:**
            1. **Use the suggestions above** - I've analyzed the conflicts and provided quick-fix buttons (which use "Commit suggestion" to apply changes).
            2. **Use GitHub's web editor** - Click the "Resolve conflicts" button for a visual editor
            3. **Use your local editor** - Pull the changes locally and edit the files manually

            Hey team, my apologies! I encountered an error while trying to post the conflict resolution review. This often means there was an issue with how I tried to suggest changes (e.g., trying to comment on a line that no longer exists in the PR's current diff).
            
            **What you can do:**
            1. Check the **[Files changed tab]({pr.html_url}/files)** to see if there are any existing conflict markers
            2. Use the **[Resolve conflicts button]({pr.html_url}/conflicts)** to resolve conflicts manually
            3. Or resolve locally with: `git merge origin/{BASE_BRANCH}` and fix conflicts in your editor
